# General information

To access the CoinCap API (https://www.coincap.io), you need a (free) API key. Although this is free, it is subject to a monthly limited quota. As soon as your credit is used up, no further queries are available - however, the quota is automatically reset at the beginning of each month.

In order to use the dashboard and the currency converter function, visitors must first register and log in on the landing page. They can only access the application once they have successfully logged in.
